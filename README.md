# ToolsAndPrograms
This is a repository for various tools, programs, and projects that I have created and am working on. All the programs in this repository are completely open source. You can branch and develop them to your will. Though if there are production versions of the programs, such as the YoWiki application, then they will come from Master. The Master branch will be controlled and administered by me and any other admins that I choose. 

Below is a short description of the various projects that are currently in this Repository. You can find more detialed information on each project within its folder.

## 1. File Reverse Project
This is a program that is used to reverse and process the very specifically formatted files that fed tools that I used for a research project during college. Though there are some options to reverse a normal file, this project will be mainly useless to most people. This is a console app written in Java and developed using the Intellij IDE.

## 2. YoWiki
YoWiki is a Xamarin.Forms application for Android, iOS, and the Universal Windows Platform which allows for offline wikipedia access. It is a fairly primitive app which connects directly to the Wikipedia API to search pages. It will the download the requested page's HTML code and convert it into text that can, hopefully, be read easily by the user. There is a lot of work that still needs to be done on this app and development will continue in the coming months. YoWiki is developed in Visual Studio using C# and Xaml.
